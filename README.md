Introduction:
---------------------
The following Kotlin program is designed to enhance the security of your sensitive text data. It takes a plain text string as input and converts it into a coded string using a unique encryption algorithm. This coded string can only be deciphered by the same program, making it a secure way to protect your data from prying eyes.

Program Features:
---------------------
1. **Input String**: The program accepts a plain text string as input.

2. **Encryption**: It employs a custom encryption algorithm to convert the input string into a coded form. This algorithm is designed to ensure that the resulting code can only be decrypted by this specific program.

3. **Decryption**: The program can also decrypt the coded string back into its original plain text form, making it reversible when needed.

4. **Data Security**: By using this program, your sensitive information is protected, as only someone with access to this program can decrypt the data.

Usage Instructions:
---------------------
1. Run the program in your Kotlin environment.

2. Enter the plain text string that you want to encrypt when prompted.

3. The program will encrypt the input string and display the corresponding coded string.

4. To decrypt the coded string, simply use the same program and choose the decryption option.

Example:
---------------------
Let's illustrate the program's functionality with an example:

Input:
```
Plain Text: "This is a confidential message."
```

Output:
```
Coded String: "-,IZWCTQQNIESVBJ-NMXXLIJ-QCCSIS"
```

Decryption of the Coded String:
```
Decrypted Text: "This is a confidential message."
```

Security Note:
---------------------
It's important to keep this program and its source code secure since anyone with access to it can decrypt the coded strings. Ensure that you store the program and its source code in a safe and confidential manner.

In conclusion, this Kotlin program provides a reliable and secure method for encrypting and decrypting text data. It's a valuable tool for safeguarding sensitive information while ensuring that only authorized users can access the original content.
